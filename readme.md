This is a simple implementation of a Blackjack card game in C++. The game allows multiple players to participate, and it runs in a console-based environment where players enter their names, set a score threshold, and receive cards from a deck to reach or exceed the threshold, while avoiding going over 21 (busting).
Features

    Players can set a threshold score.
    Each player is dealt cards until their score meets or exceeds the threshold.
    The game handles busts (when a playerâ€™s score exceeds 21).
    At the end of the game, the player(s) with the highest score without busting wins.
    Displays player names, scores, and cards dealt.
